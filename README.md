# User Gcripts

Just some user scritps I wrote to fix a few annoying things on the
web.

## Scripts

### `hacker_news-folding_subtrees.user.js`

Folding comments for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).

### `fark-redirect_remover.user.js`

Removes the tracking redirector for most of
[Fark](http://fark.com)'s headlines. (unfortunately, URLs longer
than 99 characters are truncated, and require a redirector lookup
to discover the true URL).
